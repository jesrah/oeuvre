	            	<br><span class="title">
	            	the hydro dune</span><br><br>

	            	each undulation of sound <br>
								manifests itself around <br>
								lacework white edging silken blue <br>
								the gull's wing frames these marvelous hues <br><br>
								the sun's downward journey sends gold ashore <br>
								passerby give no second glance to this treasure stored <br>
								upon each green crest, then violet, then red <br>
								a palette of wonder haloes my head <br><br>
								five ancient birds sink the sun into the sea <br>
								and the evening waves sing silence to me <br>
								an endless sigh as water falls onto land <br>
								and slowly becomes covered with starry bands <br>
								of light sent through mist from she, the moon <br>
								her messenger the albatross crosses the hydrodune <br><br>
								painted clouds sink into the horizon and dissolve into the night, <br>
								the ocean's winking twin the sky<br>
								burns with the knowledge of her end <br>
								thrown into rippling wave she does descend <br>
								sending up her scent and her final song <br>
								her romance of the sea rings long<br><br>
	            	
	            	<br><span class="title">
	            	drottning</span><br><br>

								A little red queen sat on a train  <br>
								That wove a silver thread <br>
								Through a tapestry of birch and pine <br>
								Thatched with sleepy lakes and vintage cars <br>
								Set out to dry beneath a dove grey sky <br>
								Matchstick pines, dressed to the nines, <br>
								Stood up straight as she passed them by <br>
								Rust red houses, and periwinkle too, <br>
								Winked at her as she glided on through <br>
								She saw swallows and swifts and clumps of sheep <br>
								Raining, whispery willows in ochre and cream <br>
								A field full of sitting swans made her sigh <br>
								And the passing thought of her golden prince, <br>
								That made her cry. <br><br>

								The tears of a queen <br>
								Are no different than rain <br>
								So she shut the window  <br>
								And did not cry again. <br><br>

								<br><span class="title">
	            	letter to a future lover</span><br><br>

								there are always birds between us<br>
								creatures made of dreams and electricity<br>
								fly seamlessly<br>
								they sink the sun into the sea<br>
								I catch a fish and you tell me<br>
								the colors are signs<br>
								and what’s yours is mine<br><br>

								I make a promise to you that one day<br>
								we will travel to those emerald plains<br>
								and kiss the elephants that we see<br>
								they will remember for centuries<br><br>

								we then will swim east into years past<br>
								when you rode trains through starry lands<br>
								my artist there will receive us in a dream<br>
								she will show us what she means<br><br>

								then we three will parasail<br>
								into five hundred years of silk<br>
								we will dance and sing and wear gold rings<br>
								and drink the shepherd’s sweetest milk<br><br>

								your jeweled tongue will dress me in tales<br>
								and speak the language of the monsoon<br>
								as she sweeps us through her hydro dune<br>
								through coveted mountains covered with beads<br>
								your father’s land will turn into my father’s sea<br><br>

								in that realm of music and rain<br>
								that once was the white tiger’s domain<br>
								we will find who we are again<br><br>

								lay our heads to sleep on unraveled mystery<br>
								our birds will only sing this new history<br><br>

	            	fireworks</span><br><br>

								every fourth of july<br>
								my Sister would wear<br>
								lipstick the color of plums<br>
								and she would tell me fireworks<br>
								were the saddest kinds of stars<br><br>
								they could never reach their Sisters in the sky<br>
								and so they drowned themselves<br>
								became light and ashes<br>
								snaking into the water<br>
								that cheap mirror<br><br>
